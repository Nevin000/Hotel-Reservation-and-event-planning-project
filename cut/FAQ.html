                <p>

                    <br><br><br><br><br>With its tropical environment, Bali has warm and pleasant weather all year. <br>
                    Temperatures in most coastal locations range from 25 and 32 degrees Celsius (77 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit),
                     making it suitable for beach sports and outdoor adventures.<br> Bali has two different seasons:
                      the dry (April to September) and the wet (October to March).<br>
                       The dry season gives plenty of sunshine and little rainfall, whereas the wet season brings showers and higher humidity. <br>
                       Even during the wet season, however, Bali provides plenty opportunities to explore and enjoy its natural beauty. <br>
                       Check the weather forecast before your journey, 
                       but rest confident that Bali's climate will provide a comfortable setting for your vacation.
